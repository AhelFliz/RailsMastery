# When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.
# You donâ€™t need to draw an actual stick figure (though you can if you want to!), but do display some sort of count so the player knows how many more
# incorrect guesses they have before the game ends. You should also display which correct letters have already been
# chosen (and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which incorrect letters have already been chosen.
# Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter. It should be case insensitive. Update the display to
# reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.
# Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player should also have the option
